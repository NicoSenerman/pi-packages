# pi-permission-system

Pi extension that enforces deterministic permission gates over tool, bash, MCP, skill, and special operations so the agent cannot silently exceed the policy a user has configured.

This package is a full fork of [`MasuRii/pi-permission-system`](https://github.com/MasuRii/pi-permission-system).
It began as a config-layout divergence (#10) and has since diverged substantially in config format, internal architecture, and permission model.
The `/permission-system` slash command name is the only upstream identity preserved.

Read `docs/plans/` before making architectural changes.
Pre-monorepo plans from the upstream fork live in `docs/plans/archive/` — issue numbers there refer to the upstream repo, not this monorepo.

`docs/architecture/architecture.md` tracks the improvement phases as a flat numbered step list plus a Mermaid graph — one issue per step, never a chain inside a single node label.
When a plan touches that roadmap, enumerate the whole phase: search dependents too (`gh issue list --search "#N"`), not just the issues the current one references.
When a roadmap step ships, mark it complete in `docs/architecture/architecture.md` (append `✓ complete` to the step line) as part of the shipping change — do not leave it for a later session.

## Implementation Priorities

- Default to least privilege — when in doubt, prompt (`ask`), do not silently allow.
- Enforce permissions deterministically; the same policy + same input must always produce the same decision.
- Keep config files the source of truth; do not bake policy into code.
- Hide denied tools from the agent before it starts (tool filtering + system-prompt sanitization).
- Keep block/ask/allow decisions reviewable: write to the permission review log by default.
- Preserve the `/permission-system` slash command name — renaming it is a breaking change.
- In the flat permission format, `permission["*"]` is the universal fallback; pattern ordering is last-match-wins.
- Wildcard matching must be explicit and tested — silent over-matching is a permission bypass.
- Prefer config patterns over new runtime mechanisms.
  Mechanism is forever; docs are reversible.
- Treat any declared config field not read at runtime as a maintenance trap.

### Single source of truth for tool policy

Pi-subagents removed its `disallowed_tools` frontmatter field and `extensions: string[]` allowlist (pi-subagents Phase 14, #237, #238, #239 — shipped).
This package is the **sole authority** for tool access control.
Users migrating from `disallowed_tools` should use `permission:` frontmatter in agent definitions:

```yaml
# Before (pi-subagents, removed in Phase 14)
disallowed_tools: bash

# After (pi-permission-system)
permission:
  bash: deny
```

### Event-based subagent integration

`@gotgenes/pi-subagents` emits a child-execution lifecycle on `pi.events` (`subagents:child:*`); this package subscribes via `subscribeSubagentLifecycle` (`src/subagent-lifecycle-events.ts`) and registers/unregisters child sessions in the `SubagentSessionRegistry` on `session-created` / `disposed` (pi-subagents [#261], [ADR-0002]).
The dependency direction is inverted — pi-subagents has zero knowledge of pi-permission-system.
The `session-created` handler MUST stay synchronous: the core emits it on the same call stack right before `bindExtensions()`, and the event bus dispatches listeners synchronously, so a synchronous handler lands the registry entry before binding proceeds.

**The `SubagentSessionRegistry` is process-global.**
Access it via `getSubagentSessionRegistry()` (`src/subagent-registry.ts`), backed by `globalThis` + `Symbol.for("@gotgenes/pi-permission-system:subagent-registry")`.
This is necessary because each session's `ResourceLoader` creates its own `pi.events` bus: the parent emits `subagents:child:session-created` on its bus and only the parent's instance receives it.
The child's separate jiti instance runs on a different bus and never receives the event — but `getSubagentSessionRegistry()` returns the same global store, so the parent's registration is visible to the child when it checks `isSubagentExecutionContext()`.
Do not instantiate `new SubagentSessionRegistry()` in production code; use the accessor.
This lesson comes from issue [#296]: the regression where `permission-bridge.ts` was retired in favour of `pi.events` registration but the per-session bus split meant the child never saw the registration.

## Configuration

One unified config file per scope, following the `pi-autoformat` convention (`extensions/<id>/config.json`).

- **Global config**: `~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-permission-system/config.json` (respects `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`)
- **Project config**: `<cwd>/.pi/extensions/pi-permission-system/config.json`
- **Per-agent overrides**: YAML frontmatter in agent definition files

Merge precedence: project overrides global; per-agent frontmatter overrides both.
The `permission` object uses deep-shallow merge; scalar fields use simple replacement.

- Schema: `schemas/permissions.schema.json`
- Example: `config/config.example.json`
- Keep schema, example config, `docs/configuration.md`, `README.md`, and TypeScript types/loaders aligned — changing one without the others is a bug.
- `docs/architecture/architecture.md` inline-copies the core `rule.ts` types (`Rule`, `RuleOrigin`, `Ruleset`).
  Adding or removing a field on one of these must update that listing too — a module-move check misses it, and only the pre-completion reviewer catches it otherwise.
- When removing a config field, keep the loader tolerant: detect the legacy key, emit a non-fatal config issue, and discard the value.
- When adding an optional field to `PermissionSystemExtensionConfig`, do not include it in `DEFAULT_EXTENSION_CONFIG` with an explicit `undefined` value — tests use `deepEqual` and it breaks equality.
- When adding a field to `PermissionSystemExtensionConfig`, also carry it through the loader's `UnifiedPermissionConfig` (`config-loader.ts`): parse it in `normalizeUnifiedConfig()` and merge it in `mergeUnifiedConfigs()`.
  A field on the runtime type but not the merge intermediate is silently dropped before runtime (the #332 / #347 bug class).
  After #356, omitting a field from `UnifiedPermissionConfig` that `normalizePermissionSystemConfig` reads is a **compile error** — `normalizePermissionSystemConfig` reads fields directly from the typed `UnifiedPermissionConfig` parameter, so `tsc` catches the gap immediately.
- When a config example sets a policy for `write`, include the same policy for `edit` — both tools modify files and users expect them gated together.

## Cross-Extension Integration

Pi's extension loader creates a fresh jiti instance per extension with `moduleCache: false`.
Module-scoped state is isolated — a variable set in this extension's module is invisible to other extensions.

Shared communication channels:

- **`pi.events`** (the event bus) — for fire-and-forget broadcasts and RPC.
- **`globalThis` + `Symbol.for()`** — process-global by spec, survives jiti isolation.
  Use for direct service access.

The in-process implementation of `PermissionsService` is `LocalPermissionsService` (`src/permissions-service.ts`).
The `session_start`-gated publication, #302 subagent-child guard, ready-event emit, and session teardown ordering are all owned by `PermissionServiceLifecycle` (`src/service-lifecycle.ts`), which is injected into `SessionLifecycleHandler`.
Changes to publication timing or teardown order should go through `PermissionServiceLifecycle`, not `index.ts`.

Do not propose module-scoped singletons or Node.js module-cache sharing as a cross-extension communication mechanism — they do not work under jiti.

The `path` and `external_directory` gates are path-aware for **all** tools, not just the six built-ins (#352).
`getToolInputPath` (`src/path-utils.ts`) extracts a path for built-ins (`input.path`), MCP (`input.arguments.path`), and extension tools (default `input.path`, or a custom key via a registered extractor); `getPathBearingToolPath` stays built-in-only for the per-tool gate's cosmetic suggestion/log values.
The `ToolAccessExtractorRegistry` (`src/tool-access-extractor-registry.ts`) mirrors `ToolInputFormatterRegistry`: one instance created in `index.ts`, its lookup threaded into `ToolCallGatePipeline`, its registrar exposed cross-extension via `PermissionsService.registerToolAccessExtractor`.
Extension/MCP path gating is default-on (no registration needed); per-tool path maps for extension tools (threading the extractor through `normalizeInput`) are a deferred follow-up.

## Testing

Shared test fixtures live in `test/helpers/`:

- `session-fixtures.ts` — real-instance builders for `PermissionSession` / `PermissionResolver` tests: `makeRealSession` (builds a real `PermissionSession` from per-collaborator fakes; returns `{ session, paths, logger, forwarding, permissionManager, sessionRules, configStore, gateway }`), `makeFakePermissionManager` (fake `ScopedPermissionManager` with `vi.fn()` stubs — unannotated return type for full mock access; includes a `checkPathPolicy` stub for the cross-cutting `path` surface alongside `checkPermission`, #393), `makeRealResolver` (real `PermissionResolver` over a fake manager + `SessionRules`; pass shared instances to connect it to a session's manager/rules), plus `makePaths` / `makeLogger` / `makeConfigStore` / `makeGateway` / `makeForwarding`.
  Tests exercising `resolveAgentName` must mock `active-agent` in their own file (the `vi.hoisted` / `vi.mock` pattern), since that mock is module-scoped.
- `handler-fixtures.ts` — `makeCtx`, `makeEvents`, `makeToolRegistry`, `makeToolCallEvent`, `makeCheckResult` (neutral default, override-driven), `makeHandler` (builds a **real** `PermissionSession` + `PermissionResolver` wired into the handler and pipelines exactly as `index.ts`; the `session` override bag maps `checkPermission` onto `permissionManager.checkPermission` and `getActiveSkillEntries` / `getInfrastructureReadDirs` / `getToolPreviewLimits` / `resolveAgentName` onto `vi.spyOn` overrides of the real session; accepts optional `tools: string[]` and `prompter: GatePrompter`; returns `{ handler, events, session, logger, toolRegistry, prompter, recorder, permissionManager, forwarding }` — `session.activate` is the real method, so assert `forwarding.start` instead), `makeSurfaceCheck` / `makeBashCommandCheck` (surface-/bash-dispatching `checkPermission` mocks — pass the result as `session.checkPermission`, applied to `permissionManager.checkPermission`), `getDecisionEvents`.
  `MockGateHandlerSession` now covers only the pipeline-input surface (`ToolCallGateInputs & SkillInputGateInputs`); the wide 17-field intersection mock and the standalone `makeSession` factory are gone (#341).
- `gate-fixtures.ts` — `makeDescriptor`, `makeGateRunner` (constructs a `GateRunner` with four role mocks and returns `{ runner, deps }` so tests can invoke `runner.run(...)` and assert on `deps.reporter.*`, `deps.resolve`, etc.; accepts optional `resolveResult: PermissionCheckResult` shortcut — wraps `resolve` in a `vi.fn` returning that value, taking precedence over the default allow result), `makeDenialDescriptor` (write-surface variant of `makeDescriptor` with a caller-supplied `DenialContext` — use when testing denial-message formatting), `makeReporter` (`DecisionReporter` mock with `writeReviewLog`/`emitDecision` vi.fn stubs), `makeResolver` (`ScopedPermissionResolver` mock — plain object with `vi.fn` `resolve` and `resolvePathPolicy` stubs; pass a `PermissionCheckResult` to set the default return value for both; omitting the arg leaves them returning `undefined` so callers must call `mockReturnValue` or pass a result explicitly), `makePathDispatchResolver` (resolver that dispatches on `input.path` for `resolve` and on any matching value in the `values` array for `resolvePathPolicy` — pass a `byPath` map and a `defaultResult`; the bash path gate now calls `resolvePathPolicy(policyValues)`, so multi-token path tests key `byPath` by the token's policy values, #393), `makeTcc` (bash defaults: `toolName: "bash"`, `input: { command: "cat .env" }` — passing `{ input: { command: "cat .env" } }` explicitly is redundant and can be omitted), `makeGateCheckResult` (path-surface defaults: `toolName: "path"`, `source: "special"`, `origin: "global"`), `makeGateInputs` (mock of `ToolCallGateInputs` for `ToolCallGatePipeline` unit tests — stubs the three query methods `getActiveSkillEntries`, `getInfrastructureReadDirs`, `getToolPreviewLimits`; the resolver is now a separate `makeResolver(makeCheckResult())` passed as the first arg to `ToolCallGatePipeline` — `makeGateInputs` no longer stubs `resolve`), `makeSkillInputInputs` (mock of `SkillInputGateInputs` for `SkillInputGatePipeline` unit tests — single-method stub for `checkPermission`; returns `makeCheckResult()` by default), `makeNotifier` (`GateNotifier` mock — unannotated return type so callers retain full `vi.fn()` access on `warn`).
  `makeRunnerDeps` has been deleted; `GateRunnerDeps` no longer exists.
- `manager-harness.ts` — `createManager` (filesystem-backed `PermissionManager`), `createManagerWithProject` (two-level harness with global + project config dirs and per-level agent files; returns `{ manager, cleanup }` — use when testing project-level or project-agent precedence).
- `make-fake-pi.ts` — `makeFakePi` (composition-root harness): runs the real `piPermissionSystemExtension(pi)` factory against a fake `ExtensionAPI` with a real `createEventBus()`, an inspectable `handlers` map, captured `commands`, and a `fire(event, input, ctx)` driver.
  Use it for composition-root wiring tests (handler-registration completeness, shared-instance contracts, teardown, event ordering) — see `test/composition-root.test.ts`.
  Composition-root tests must `vi.stubEnv("PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR", <tmpdir>)` and clear both `Symbol.for()` global slots (`:service`, `:subagent-registry`) in `afterEach`, since the factory mutates process-global state.

Import from these instead of redefining factories inline.
When a call site needs different defaults from `makeCheckResult`, pass explicit overrides (e.g. `makeCheckResult({ state: "deny", matchedPattern: "*" })`).

When a gate resolves through a new manager/resolver method beyond `checkPermission`/`resolve` (e.g. `checkPathPolicy`/`resolvePathPolicy`), wire it through the same surface dispatcher in `makeHandler` (`handler-fixtures.ts`).
Otherwise `makeSurfaceCheck` stubs only `checkPermission`, the new method returns its default, and the gate silently passes `allow` — a false green caught only by the full suite, not the edited test file (#393).

- Test permission resolution (allow/deny/ask decisions across tools, bash, MCP, skills, special).
- Test wildcard matching (bash patterns, skill globs) including over-match and under-match cases.
- Test policy merge precedence: global → project → per-agent frontmatter.
- Test system-prompt sanitization (denied tools removed, allowed tools preserved).
- Test the external-directory guard for path-bearing file tools, including extension and MCP tools (default-on path gating, #352).
- Test config loading, validation issues, and tolerance of deprecated keys.
- To test the file-based permission-forwarding round-trip (a subagent's `ask` reaching the parent), do not `await` the child's `pi.fire("tool_call", …)` directly — `PermissionForwarder.requestApproval` polls for a response with a 10-minute timeout when forwarding to the parent.
  Instead: fire without awaiting, poll the parent's `requests/` dir (`createPermissionForwardingLocation(forwardingDir, parentSessionId)`) for the child's request file, write an approval JSON to `responses/<id>.json`, then await the fire.
  See the `subagent registry sharing` test in `test/composition-root.test.ts`.

## Debugging

When investigating a reported bug:

1. Check the runtime environment: which extensions are loaded, from which paths, and whether any are loaded more than once.
2. Check `.pi/settings.json` and `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` for overlapping package entries.
3. Instrument only after confirming the bug reproduces in isolation.
4. When the bug involves path, filesystem, or platform semantics, check how `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` solves it first (local checkout or published source).
   Prefer Node `path` builtins (`path.relative`, `path.win32`/`path.posix`) over hand-rolled comparison; pi's containment idiom is `relative()` + a `..`/absolute-prefix check (case-insensitive on Windows).

## Notes for Agents

Before implementing, understand:

1. The problem being solved.
2. Which permission surface is involved (tools / bash / mcp / skills / special / external_directory).
3. The merge precedence between global, project, and per-agent policies.
4. Whether the change renames the `/permission-system` slash command — if yes, it is breaking.
5. The need to keep schema, example config, loader, and docs aligned.

Do not assume "allow" is a safe default.
Do not add a permission surface without also adding a policy field, schema entry, and example.

When writing documentation that claims this extension lacks a feature, verify by searching `src/`, `docs/retro/`, and closed issues.

When planning a refactoring that targets testability, read the test files alongside the production code.

When planning a refactoring that touches handler wiring or shared interfaces, load the `design-review` skill to audit for structural smells before writing the plan.

The bash `external_directory` gate only sees tokens that `classifyTokenAsPathCandidate` accepts — absolute, `~/`-relative, or `..`-traversal paths.
A plain `./relative` token (e.g. `cat ./link/hosts`) is dropped before that gate and is instead gated by the broader `path` surface (`classifyTokenAsRuleCandidate`).
When a plan or test asserts a specific bash repro string, trace the token through the classifier first — an issue's headline repro can describe a symptom whose literal input never reaches the gate being changed.
