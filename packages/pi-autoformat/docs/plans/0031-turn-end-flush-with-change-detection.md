# Turn-end flush with change detection

## Problem Statement

pi-autoformat runs its formatter flush at `agent_end`, which fires after the agent's full turn loop completes.
In TDD and commit-heavy workflows, the agent writes files in one turn and commits them in a later turn.
Because formatting has not yet run, pre-commit hooks (e.g. Biome via prek) reject the commit.
The agent then has to run the formatter manually, re-stage, and retry — wasting tokens and time.

Observed in `pi-permission-system`: 3 of ~10 commits required retry after Biome rejection.

The typical pattern across 4,925 analysed turns:

```text
Turn N:   edit src/foo.ts        (single tool call)
Turn N+1: edit src/bar.ts        (single tool call)
Turn N+2: bash("git add ... \n git commit -m '...'")
```

93.4% of turns contain exactly one tool call.
Writes and commits always occur in separate turns.
Zero instances of same-file edits within a single turn were found across all session data.

## Goals

1. Move the primary formatter flush from `agent_end` to `turn_end` so files are formatted between turns — before any subsequent commit.
2. Detect whether formatting actually changed file content (content hashing before/after) and only notify the agent when changes occurred or the formatter failed.
3. Notify the agent inline via a steering message (`pi.sendMessage` during streaming) so it sees the notification before its next LLM call.
4. Remove the `notifyAgent` config field; turn-end steering replaces the `agent_end` follow-up turn mechanism.
5. Keep `agent_end` as a safety-net flush for any files not yet formatted (e.g. files added via EventBus without a turn loop).

## Non-Goals

1. Re-staging formatted files in the git index — session data shows `git add` and `git commit` always share the same bash command, run in a turn after formatting has already occurred.
2. Command detection for `git commit` at `tool_call` — the turn-end flush makes this unnecessary; the intra-turn write+commit pattern has never occurred in session data.
3. Exposing an explicit flush tool or slash command for agents.
4. Byte-level diffs or line-change summaries in the notification — file names and failure details are sufficient.

## Background

### Session data analysis

| Metric                                     | Count | %     |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----- | ----- |
| Total turns with tools                     | 4,925 | 100%  |
| Single-tool turns                          | 4,515 | 91.7% |
| Multi-tool turns                           | 410   | 8.3%  |
| Same-file edits in same turn               | 0     | 0%    |
| Read-after-write to same file in same turn | 0     | 0%    |
| Write + git commit in same turn            | 0     | 0%    |

The original argument against per-turn formatting was that it could corrupt `Edit` tool `oldText` matching or `Read` tool `offset`/`limit` when a formatter changes a file between two tool calls targeting the same file within a turn.
The session data shows this scenario has never occurred.

### Pi agent loop lifecycle (from source)

```text
OUTER LOOP:
  INNER LOOP (while hasMoreToolCalls || pendingMessages):
    turn_start
      process pendingMessages (steering messages from previous turn)
      LLM generates response
      execute tool calls sequentially:
        beforeToolCall → tool runs → afterToolCall (tool_result)
    turn_end  ← FLUSH HERE, send steering message if changes
      shouldStopAfterTurn? (not used by coding-agent)
      pendingMessages = getSteeringMessages()  ← PICKS UP OUR MESSAGE
  END INNER LOOP

  followUpMessages = getFollowUpMessages()
  if followUp → continue outer loop
  else → break
agent_end  ← SAFETY-NET FLUSH
```

Key properties:

- `turn_end` is fully `await`ed before the next `turn_start`.
- During the turn loop, `isStreaming` is `true`; `pi.sendMessage()` defaults to `agent.steer()`.
- Steering messages are consumed as `pendingMessages` at the start of the next turn, injected before the LLM call.
- When the agent's final turn has no tool calls (text-only), the queue is empty, so the turn-end flush is a no-op and no steering message is sent.

### Relationship to plan 0027

Plan 0027 introduced `notifyAgent` (default `false`), which sends a follow-up turn at `agent_end` via `pi.sendMessage({ triggerTurn: true })`.
This plan replaces that mechanism: formatting moves to `turn_end` with inline steering, making the `agent_end` follow-up unnecessary.
The `notifyAgent` field is removed per the deprecation policy in AGENTS.md.

## Design Overview

### Flush at `turn_end`

Register a new `turn_end` handler in `src/extension.ts`.
On each `turn_end` event, call `queueFlush(ctx)`.
The queue contains files recorded during the turn's `tool_result` events.
After the flush, the queue is empty; the next turn starts with clean files on disk.

### Content-change detection

Wrap the formatter execution with before/after content hashing to determine which files were actually changed.

Add a `changedFiles` field to `ChainGroupResult`:

```typescript
export type ChainGroupResult = {
  chain: ChainStep[];
  files: string[];
  runs: BatchRun[];
  changedFiles: string[];  // files whose content changed after formatting
};
```

In `flushPrompt()`, before running each chain group's formatter:

1. Read and hash (SHA-256) each input file.
2. Run the formatter.
3. Re-read and hash each file.
4. Populate `changedFiles` with files whose hash differs.

Files that no longer exist after formatting (deleted by the formatter — unusual but possible) are excluded from `changedFiles`.

The hashing cost is 2× reads per formatted file.
These files are small source files already in the OS page cache (just written by the agent moments ago), so the overhead is negligible.

### Steering notification

After the flush, if any files changed or any run failed, compose a steering message and call `pi.sendMessage()`.
During the turn loop, `isStreaming` is `true`, so `sendMessage` defaults to `agent.steer()`.
The message is consumed as `pendingMessages` at the start of the next turn.

Message format:

```text
[autoformat] Formatted 2 file(s): src/foo.ts, src/bar.ts
```

When there are failures:

```text
[autoformat] Formatted 1 file(s): src/foo.ts

Failures:
  biome (exit 1) on src/broken.ts:
    SyntaxError: Unexpected token at line 42
```

When only failures (no successful changes):

```text
[autoformat] Failures:
  biome (exit 1) on src/broken.ts:
    SyntaxError: Unexpected token at line 42
```

File list truncated at 10 with "… and N more" suffix.
Failure details use the existing `formatterOutput` config limits.

No message is sent when:

- The flush processed no files (empty queue).
- The formatter ran but no files changed and no runs failed.

### Removing `notifyAgent`

Per AGENTS.md deprecation policy:

- Remove `notifyAgent` from `AutoformatConfig`, `UserFormatterConfig`, `createFormatterConfig()`.
- Remove from `schemas/pi-autoformat.schema.json` and `docs/configuration.md`.
- In `src/config-loader.ts`: when `notifyAgent` key is present, emit a config issue (`notifyAgent has been removed; the extension now notifies via steering messages at turn end.`) and discard.
- Remove the `agent_end` follow-up turn logic (`followUpPending`, `buildNotifyMessageContent`, `pi.sendMessage({ triggerTurn: true })`).
- Remove `followUpPending` from `SessionState`.

### `agent_end` safety net

The `agent_end` handler still calls `queueFlush(ctx)` as a safety net for files added via EventBus or other non-turn paths.
It no longer sends follow-up turns.
In the normal case, `turn_end` has already drained the queue, so the `agent_end` flush is a no-op.

Add `turn_end` to the `EventName` type.
Keep `sendMessage` capture for steering-message assertions.

## Risks and Mitigations

### Formatter latency between turns

Formatting at `turn_end` adds latency between turns — the agent waits for the formatter before its next LLM call.
Mitigation: most turns have 1-3 touched files; formatter runs are typically sub-second.
The existing `commandTimeoutMs` config prevents hangs.

### Steering message noise

Even with change detection, active editing sessions may produce frequent "Formatted X" messages.
Mitigation: messages are only sent when content actually changed or a formatter failed.
During long edit streaks where the agent writes already-formatted code, no messages are sent.

### File I/O from content hashing

Reading files before and after formatting doubles the I/O per formatted file.
Mitigation: files are small source files already in the OS page cache.
The hash computation (SHA-256) is negligible for typical file sizes.

### Breaking change: `notifyAgent` removal

Users who set `notifyAgent: true` will see a config issue.
Mitigation: the replacement (turn-end steering) provides strictly better behavior — inline notification during the turn rather than a follow-up turn after the agent finishes.
The deprecation policy (accept, warn, discard) ensures no hard failure.

### `turn_end` not firing for non-turn paths

Files added via EventBus or `session_shutdown` never pass through `turn_end`.
Mitigation: `agent_end` and `session_shutdown` safety-net flushes handle these paths.

## Open Questions

1. Should the steering message include which formatter ran (e.g. "biome formatted src/foo.ts") or just the file list?
   Start with the file list; add formatter names if users find it useful.

2. Should there be a config to disable turn-end formatting entirely (revert to agent-end-only)?
   Defer until someone needs it.
   If needed, the implementation can gate the `turn_end` flush behind a boolean.
